In Symfony using Doctrine ORM, you define relationships directly within the entity class. Here's an example of how you can implement the relationships in your Symfony User entity:

```php
// src/Entity/User.php

namespace App\Entity;

use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping as ORM;
use Symfony\Component\Security\Core\User\UserInterface;

/**
 * @ORM\Entity(repositoryClass="App\Repository\UserRepository")
 * @ORM\Table(name="users")
 */
class User implements UserInterface
{
    // ... (other properties)

    /**
     * @ORM\ManyToOne(targetEntity="Role", inversedBy="users")
     * @ORM\JoinColumn(name="role_id", referencedColumnName="id")
     */
    private $role;

    /**
     * @ORM\OneToMany(targetEntity="Address", mappedBy="user")
     */
    private $addresses;

    /**
     * @ORM\OneToOne(targetEntity="Cart", mappedBy="user")
     */
    private $cart;

    // ... (other methods)

    // Implement getters and setters for relationships

    public function getRole()
    {
        return $this->role;
    }

    public function setRole(Role $role)
    {
        $this->role = $role;

        return $this;
    }

    public function getAddresses()
    {
        return $this->addresses;
    }

    public function addAddress(Address $address)
    {
        $this->addresses[] = $address;

        return $this;
    }

    public function removeAddress(Address $address)
    {
        $this->addresses->removeElement($address);

        return $this;
    }

    public function getCart()
    {
        return $this->cart;
    }

    public function setCart(Cart $cart)
    {
        $this->cart = $cart;

        return $this;
    }

    // ... (other methods)

    // Implement UserInterface methods if needed

    public function getUsername()
    {
        return $this->email;
    }

    public function getPassword()
    {
        return $this->password;
    }

    // ... (other UserInterface methods)
}
```

In this example:

- `@ORM\ManyToOne` is used for the many-to-one relationship with the `Role` entity. This specifies that many users can be associated with one role.
- `@ORM\OneToMany` is used for the one-to-many relationship with the `Address` entity. This specifies that one user can have many addresses.
- `@ORM\OneToOne` is used for the one-to-one relationship with the `Cart` entity. This specifies that one user can have one cart.

Make sure to update the code according to your specific needs and relationships in your application. Also, ensure that you have the necessary entities (e.g., `Role`, `Address`, `Cart`) defined with their respective relationships.
