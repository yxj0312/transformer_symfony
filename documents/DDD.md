Certainly! Designing a Symfony project using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) involves organizing your entities, aggregates, repositories, and services based on business domains. Here's a simplified example for your online shop:

1. **Entities:**
    - `Product`
    - `User`
    - `Brand`
    - `Cart`
    - `Category`
    - `Order`
    - `Payment`
    - `Review`
    - `Role`
    - `Coupon`

2. **Domains:**
    - **Product Domain:**
        - Entities: `Product`, `Brand`, `Category`
        - Aggregates: `Product` (main aggregate root)
        - Repositories: `ProductRepository`

    - **User Domain:**
        - Entities: `User`, `Role`
        - Aggregates: `User` (main aggregate root)
        - Repositories: `UserRepository`

    - **Order Domain:**
        - Entities: `Order`, `Cart`, `Payment`
        - Aggregates: `Order` (main aggregate root)
        - Repositories: `OrderRepository`

    - **Review Domain:**
        - Entities: `Review`
        - Aggregates: `Review` (can be aggregate root)
        - Repositories: `ReviewRepository`

    - **Coupon Domain:**
        - Entities: `Coupon`
        - Aggregates: `Coupon` (can be aggregate root)
        - Repositories: `CouponRepository`

3. **Interfaces/Abstract Classes:**
    - Create interfaces or abstract classes where common behavior is shared among entities within a domain. For example, you might have an interface `PaymentMethodInterface` that both `CreditCardPayment` and `PaypalPayment` implement.

4. **Repositories:**
    - Each domain should have its repository. Repositories are responsible for retrieving and persisting aggregates.
    - Example repository interfaces:
        - `ProductRepositoryInterface`
        - `UserRepositoryInterface`
        - `OrderRepositoryInterface`

5. **Services:**
    - Use services to encapsulate domain logic that doesn't naturally fit within an entity or value object.
    - Example services:
        - `OrderService` for handling order creation, modification, and checkout logic.
        - `CouponService` for applying and validating coupons.

6. **Events:**
    - Implement domain events to capture changes within a domain. For instance, you might have a `OrderPlacedEvent` triggered when an order is successfully placed.

Remember, DDD is about modeling your software based on the business domain, so adapt the structure based on your specific business rules and requirements. This is a high-level example, and you might need to dive deeper into each domain to define behaviors, invariants, and relationships more precisely.

Certainly! Below is a simplified structure for your Symfony project based on the DDD design we discussed. This structure assumes a typical Symfony project layout and is just a starting point. Adjustments might be needed based on your specific requirements and preferences.

Explanation:

- **Domain**: Contains the business logic, entities, repositories, and services for each domain (e.g., Product, User, Order).
  
- **Infrastructure**: Houses implementations of the repositories using a specific technology, such as Doctrine. It bridges the gap between the application's core (business logic) and external systems.

- **Application**: Holds application-specific services. These services coordinate actions between different domains or handle application-level logic.

- **Presentation**: Contains controllers and other elements related to the user interface layer. It interacts with the application layer to fulfill user requests.

- **Resources**: Configuration files, views, and other resources.

This is a high-level overview, and you might have additional directories depending on your project's needs. Also, don't forget to configure your Symfony services and routes accordingly.

Certainly! Below are simplified examples of classes based on the directory structure provided earlier:

### Domain

#### Product Domain

**Model/Product.php**
```php
<?php

namespace App\Domain\Product\Model;

class Product
{
    private $id;
    private $name;
    private $price;
    private $brand;
    private $category;

    // Constructor, getters, setters, and other methods...
}

class Brand
{
    private $id;
    private $name;

    // Constructor, getters, setters...
}

class Category
{
    private $id;
    private $name;

    // Constructor, getters, setters...
}
```

**Repository/ProductRepositoryInterface.php**
```php
<?php

namespace App\Domain\Product\Repository;

use App\Domain\Product\Model\Product;

interface ProductRepositoryInterface
{
    public function find($id): ?Product;
    public function save(Product $product): void;
    public function remove(Product $product): void;
}
```

**Service/ProductService.php**
```php
<?php

namespace App\Domain\Product\Service;

use App\Domain\Product\Model\Product;
use App\Domain\Product\Repository\ProductRepositoryInterface;

class ProductService
{
    private $productRepository;

    public function __construct(ProductRepositoryInterface $productRepository)
    {
        $this->productRepository = $productRepository;
    }

    public function createProduct(string $name, float $price, Brand $brand, Category $category): Product
    {
        // Business logic to create a product...
        $product = new Product($name, $price, $brand, $category);

        // Persist the product
        $this->productRepository->save($product);

        return $product;
    }

    // Other product-related business logic...
}
```

#### User Domain

**Model/User.php**
```php
<?php

namespace App\Domain\User\Model;

class User
{
    private $id;
    private $username;
    private $email;
    private $roles;

    // Constructor, getters, setters, and other methods...
}

class Role
{
    private $id;
    private $name;

    // Constructor, getters, setters...
}
```

**Repository/UserRepositoryInterface.php**
```php
<?php

namespace App\Domain\User\Repository;

use App\Domain\User\Model\User;

interface UserRepositoryInterface
{
    public function find($id): ?User;
    public function save(User $user): void;
    public function remove(User $user): void;
}
```

### Infrastructure

#### Persistence

**Doctrine/DoctrineProductRepository.php**
```php
<?php

namespace App\Infrastructure\Persistence\Doctrine;

use App\Domain\Product\Model\Product;
use App\Domain\Product\Repository\ProductRepositoryInterface;
use Doctrine\ORM\EntityManagerInterface;

class DoctrineProductRepository implements ProductRepositoryInterface
{
    private $entityManager;

    public function __construct(EntityManagerInterface $entityManager)
    {
        $this->entityManager = $entityManager;
    }

    public function find($id): ?Product
    {
        // Doctrine ORM implementation to find a product by id...
    }

    public function save(Product $product): void
    {
        // Doctrine ORM implementation to persist a product...
    }

    public function remove(Product $product): void
    {
        // Doctrine ORM implementation to remove a product...
    }
}
```

### Application

#### Service

**SomeApplicationService.php**
```php
<?php

namespace App\Application\Service;

use App\Domain\Product\Service\ProductService;

class SomeApplicationService
{
    private $productService;

    public function __construct(ProductService $productService)
    {
        $this->productService = $productService;
    }

    // Application-level logic using ProductService...
}
```

These are simplified examples, and in a real-world scenario, you'd likely have more methods, validations, and additional considerations in your classes. Ensure to adapt the code based on your specific business requirements and coding standards.
