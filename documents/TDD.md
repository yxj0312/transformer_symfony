Certainly! Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a development approach where tests are written before the actual code. Let's go through an example of how you might use TDD for a simple feature in your Symfony project, focusing on the `UserService` in the User domain.

### Example: TDD for UserService

Assuming you want to implement a method in `UserService` to add a role to a user, you might follow these steps:

1. **Write a Failing Test:**

   Create a test case in a file, say `tests/Domain/User/Service/UserServiceTest.php`, with a test that expects the new behavior. In PHPUnit, it might look like this:

   ```php
   <?php

   namespace App\Tests\Domain\User\Service;

   use App\Domain\User\Service\UserService;
   use PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase;

   class UserServiceTest extends TestCase
   {
       public function testAddRoleToUser()
       {
           $userService = new UserService(/* Dependencies go here */);
           $user = /* Create a user instance */;

           $userService->addRoleToUser($user, 'ROLE_ADMIN');

           $this->assertContains('ROLE_ADMIN', $user->getRoles());
       }
   }
   ```

   Running this test should fail because you haven't implemented the `addRoleToUser` method yet.

2. **Write the Minimum Code to Pass:**

   Implement the `addRoleToUser` method in `UserService`:

   ```php
   <?php

   namespace App\Domain\User\Service;

   use App\Domain\User\Model\User;

   class UserService
   {
       // Other methods...

       public function addRoleToUser(User $user, string $role)
       {
           $currentRoles = $user->getRoles();
           $currentRoles[] = $role;
           $user->setRoles(array_unique($currentRoles));
       }
   }
   ```

   This code should make the test pass.

3. **Refactor if Necessary:**

   After the test passes, you can refactor the code to improve it, if needed. For example, you might handle duplicate roles differently or add validation.

4. **Write Additional Tests:**

   Consider edge cases or additional scenarios, and write tests for them. For instance, you might write a test to ensure that adding the same role multiple times doesn't result in duplicates.

   ```php
   public function testAddRoleToUserDoesNotDuplicateRoles()
   {
       $userService = new UserService(/* Dependencies go here */);
       $user = /* Create a user instance with 'ROLE_ADMIN' */;

       $userService->addRoleToUser($user, 'ROLE_ADMIN');

       $this->assertCount(1, $user->getRoles());
   }
   ```

   Ensure this test fails initially and then modify the code to make it pass.

By following these steps, you are iteratively building and refining your code while ensuring that it meets the expected behavior. This TDD process helps catch issues early, provides documentation through tests, and facilitates confident code changes. Repeat this cycle for other features or methods in your application.

Yes, in a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach, it's common to have a combination of unit tests and feature tests. Each type of test serves a specific purpose in ensuring the correctness and reliability of your application.

### Unit Tests:

- **Scope:** Unit tests focus on testing small, isolated units of code, such as individual methods or functions.
- **Purpose:** Verify that each unit of code works as intended in isolation.
- **Dependencies:** External dependencies are typically replaced with test doubles (mocks, stubs, or fakes).
- **Execution Time:** Generally, unit tests run quickly and are suited for frequent execution during development.
- **Example:** Testing a single method in the `UserService` class that adds a role to a user.

### Feature Tests:

- **Scope:** Feature tests are higher-level and often involve testing the interaction of multiple components or even the entire application.
- **Purpose:** Validate that features or functionalities work correctly when integrated into the overall system.
- **Dependencies:** Real dependencies are used, and the test environment may resemble the production environment more closely.
- **Execution Time:** Feature tests might take longer to run compared to unit tests.
- **Example:** Testing the end-to-end workflow of user registration, login, and role assignment.

### When to Use Each:

1. **Start with Unit Tests:**
   - When implementing a new feature, start with unit tests to specify the behavior of small units of code.
   - Unit tests help catch and fix issues at a granular level, promoting modularity and maintainability.

2. **Progress to Feature Tests:**
   - Once you have implemented and verified the behavior of individual units, move to feature tests.
   - Feature tests ensure that the different units work together as expected and that the overall application behaves correctly.

3. **Maintain a Balance:**
   - Strive for a balance between unit tests and feature tests. Unit tests provide fast feedback during development, while feature tests ensure the correctness of the entire system.
   - Emphasize unit tests for critical or complex logic and use feature tests to cover end-to-end scenarios.

4. **Mock External Services in Unit Tests:**
   - When testing components that interact with external services (e.g., databases, APIs), use mocks or fakes in unit tests to avoid dependencies on external systems.

5. **Use Real Services in Feature Tests:**
   - Feature tests may involve using real services to test the system's integration with external components.
   - Feature tests help validate user workflows, ensuring that the application meets business requirements.

By employing both unit tests and feature tests, you create a robust testing strategy that addresses different aspects of your application. This comprehensive approach enhances code quality, provides confidence in changes, and facilitates future maintenance and enhancements.

Certainly! Let's walk through examples of both unit tests and feature tests for a simplified user management scenario in a Symfony application.

### Example: User Management

#### 1. Unit Test - UserService

Let's say you have a `UserService` with a method `addRoleToUser`. Here's a corresponding unit test using PHPUnit:

```php
// tests/Domain/User/Service/UserServiceTest.php

use App\Domain\User\Service\UserService;
use App\Domain\User\Model\User;
use PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase;

class UserServiceTest extends TestCase
{
    public function testAddRoleToUser()
    {
        $userService = new UserService(/* Dependencies go here */);
        $user = new User('john_doe', 'john@example.com', ['ROLE_USER']);

        $userService->addRoleToUser($user, 'ROLE_ADMIN');

        $this->assertEquals(['ROLE_USER', 'ROLE_ADMIN'], $user->getRoles());
    }
}
```

In this unit test, we are focusing on the `addRoleToUser` method of the `UserService`, isolating it from external dependencies.

#### 2. Feature Test - User Registration

Let's now look at a feature test for a user registration scenario:

```php
// tests/Feature/UserRegistrationTest.php

use Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Test\WebTestCase;

class UserRegistrationTest extends WebTestCase
{
    public function testUserRegistrationAndRoleAssignment()
    {
        $client = static::createClient();

        // Simulate a user registration request
        $client->request('POST', '/register', [
            'username' => 'new_user',
            'email' => 'new_user@example.com',
            'password' => 'password123',
        ]);

        $this->assertResponseRedirects('/login');

        // Simulate a login request
        $client->request('POST', '/login', [
            'username' => 'new_user',
            'password' => 'password123',
        ]);

        $this->assertResponseRedirects('/dashboard');

        // Check if the user has the expected role after registration and login
        $client->request('GET', '/dashboard');
        $this->assertSelectorTextContains('.user-roles', 'ROLE_USER');
    }
}
```

In this feature test:

- We use Symfony's testing framework to simulate HTTP requests.
- We first register a new user, then login, and finally check if the user has the expected role on the dashboard.

These examples illustrate the difference in focus between unit tests and feature tests. Unit tests concentrate on isolated units of code, while feature tests validate the behavior of the entire system or a significant part of it. The combination of both types of tests provides a comprehensive approach to testing your Symfony application.
