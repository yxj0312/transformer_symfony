Of course, I can guide you through the process of creating a `UserService`, `UserRepository`, and related unit tests for a `User` entity step by step. Let's start with creating a test for the `UserService`. We'll follow a typical TDD (Test-Driven Development) approach. Here's the process:

1. **Create a Test Case for UserService:**

   Create a test file for your `UserService` (e.g., `UserServiceTest.php`) in your Symfony project's test directory.

   ```php
   // tests/Service/UserServiceTest.php

   use App\Entity\User;
   use App\Repository\UserRepository;
   use App\Service\UserService;
   use PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase;
   use Prophecy\Argument;

   class UserServiceTest extends TestCase
   {
       private $userRepository;
       private $userService;

       protected function setUp(): void
       {
           // Create a mock UserRepository using Prophecy.
           $this->userRepository = $this->prophesize(UserRepository::class);

           // Create the UserService, injecting the mock repository.
           $this->userService = new UserService($this->userRepository->reveal());
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Write a Test for a UserService Method:**

   Let's say you want to test a method that gets a user by their ID. You can write a test for it:

   ```php
   public function testGetUserById()
   {
       // Create a user entity.
       $user = new User();
       $user->setId(1);

       // Set up the repository to return this user when 'find' is called.
       $this->userRepository->find(1)->willReturn($user);

       // Call the UserService method.
       $result = $this->userService->getUserById(1);

       // Assert that the user returned by the service is the same as the user we set up.
       $this->assertSame($user, $result);
   }
   ```

3. **Write the UserService:**

   Now you can create the `UserService` class in the `src/Service` directory. Implement the method that you've tested.

   ```php
   // src/Service/UserService.php

   namespace App\Service;

   use App\Entity\User;
   use App\Repository\UserRepository;

   class UserService
   {
       private $userRepository;

       public function __construct(UserRepository $userRepository)
       {
           $this->userRepository = $userRepository;
       }

       public function getUserById(int $userId): ?User
       {
           return $this->userRepository->find($userId);
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Register Service in Symfony:**

   In Symfony, you need to register the `UserService` as a service so that you can inject it where needed.

   ```yaml
   # config/services.yaml

   services:
       App\Service\UserService:
           arguments:
               $userRepository: '@App\Repository\UserRepository'
   ```

   This configuration assumes that you have a `UserRepository` service defined. Adjust it according to your actual repository service.

5. **Run the Tests:**

   Run your test suite to ensure that the `UserService` behaves as expected.

   ```bash
   php bin/phpunit
   ```

6. **Repeat for Other Methods:**

   You can repeat steps 2-4 for other methods you want to add to the `UserService`.

By following this process, you develop your `UserService` while making sure that it behaves as expected through unit tests. You can repeat this process for the `UserRepository` and any other services you need.
